                                <strong>Ken 'Ya Run</strong>
                                 is a charity event produced by Kenya Connection Kids, Inc. All proceeds from this race
                                will be put towards the construction of a Technical School in Chuka, Kenya. The school
                                will provide the youth of Kenya who are not eligible to attend the University training
                                in carpentry, welding, electrical, seamstress and other trades with the goal of
                                improving the economic situation of Kenya through education.
                            </p>
                             <p>The funds raised from this event will be used towards the completion of the offices and 
                             classrooms.</p>
                            <h2>The Compound</h2>
                            <img  class="img-responsive" src="resources/images/Artists rendition of Technical School.png"
                            alt="Artist's rendition of Techncial School"/>
                            <p>Being built on approximately one acre of land just to the west of the Children's Homes, 
                            the Technical School is on its way to reality. Above is an artist's rendition of the 
                            compound. As you can see it is an ambitious project for KCK.</p>
                            <p>In 2008-2009 KCK reached out in Faith and God answered our prayers with the property 
                            that was bought to house the Technical School meet future needs of the KCK programs.</p>
                            <img  class="img-responsive" src="resources/images/Layout of Technical School.png" 
                            alt="Layout of Techncial School"/>
                            <p>The final compound is designed to have the following features:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Administrative Offices for the director and his staff.</li>
                                <li>Class and Conference Rooms</li>
                                <li>A Workshop building to initially house three 26 foot by 40 foot workshops. 
                                It is designed to have a second floor added in the future.</li>
                                <li>The Men's and Women's Exit Houses</li>
                                <li>Three additional two story Children's Homes</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The priority for KCK is the school and this is the driver for this event. the Exit 
                            Houses and the Children's Homes will come later.</p>
                            
                            <h2>The Workshops</h2>
                            <p>In 2013 KCK and the Board of Directors reached out in again in Faith and dug 
                            the foundation, dedicating it to God's continuing work through the raising up and training 
                            of Orphans.</p>
                            <p>Since that time KCK has seen God act by providing, in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010, 
                            donated Industrial strength shop tools for us to ship in donated containers. In addition, 
                            donations from local Kenyan individuals, additional USA individuals, as well as some 
                            Government agencies have continued to come in. </p>
                            <p>The proceeds from the 2016 Run allowed to us to do electrical installation of the workshops 
                            together with construction of three offices inside the workshops for instructors and to act as 
                            storage facility of smaller tools. </p>
                            <p>It is with great joy to inform you that the electrical installation in the workshop is now 
                            complete. The carpentry technician who was constructing the offices had the opportunity to 
                            use our electric power tools for the first time. Alex took time to show him how to use the saws. 
                            Thanks to the training carried out by Steve Hamilton and Dickson Lester in 2013. Alex and 
                            Dennis were some of their students and it appears they were good students.</p>

                            <p>Earlier this year (2016) work started on the offices for the school. Like the workshops, 
                            construction began with a prayer. Donations have again made it possible to proceed and good 
                            progress has been made. Now (2017), the offices are also 95% complete. </p>

                            <h2>Class and Conference Rooms</h2>
                            <p>This portion of the school has not yet started. As you can imagine this is a critical 
                            aspect of a learning environment. These rooms will be used for instruction in the various topics
                            ranging from business administration and book keeping to mathematics and other subjects needed for a 
                            diploma.</p>

                            <p>These buildings have begun since our last run. With your help and the funds raised from this event and 
                            future events like this one, these building will be completed and classes can start.</p>
